# High Issues

## H-1: Arbitrary `from` passed to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`)

Passing an arbitrary `from` address to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`) can lead to loss of funds, because anyone can transfer tokens from the `from` address if an approval is made.  

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 286](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L286)

	```solidity
	        safeToken.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 350](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L350)

	```solidity
	        usdcToken.safeTransferFrom(user, address(this), usdcAmount);
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 40](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L40)

	```solidity
	contract SafeYieldPresale is Pausable, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 182](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L182)

	```solidity
	    function setTokenPrice(uint128 _price) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 190](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L190)

	```solidity
	    function setRefererCommission(uint128 _commission) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 219](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L219)

	```solidity
	    function pause() public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 227](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L227)

	```solidity
	    function unpause() public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 235](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L235)

	```solidity
	    function startPresale() public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 243](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L243)

	```solidity
	    function endPresale() public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 274](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L274)

	```solidity
	    function setAllocations(uint128 _min, uint128 _max) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 285](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L285)

	```solidity
	    function depositSafeTokens(uint128 amount, address owner) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 294](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L294)

	```solidity
	    function withdrawUSDC(address receiver) public onlyOwner {
	```



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 296](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L296)

	```solidity
	        usdcToken.transfer(receiver, balance);
	```



## L-3: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 2](src/Counter.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```



## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 7](src/Counter.sol#L7)

	```solidity
	    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
	```

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 11](src/Counter.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	    function increment() public {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 182](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L182)

	```solidity
	    function setTokenPrice(uint128 _price) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 190](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L190)

	```solidity
	    function setRefererCommission(uint128 _commission) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 210](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L210)

	```solidity
	    function calculatesSafeTokensAvailable() public view returns (uint128) {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 219](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L219)

	```solidity
	    function pause() public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 227](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L227)

	```solidity
	    function unpause() public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 235](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L235)

	```solidity
	    function startPresale() public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 243](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L243)

	```solidity
	    function endPresale() public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 274](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L274)

	```solidity
	    function setAllocations(uint128 _min, uint128 _max) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 285](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L285)

	```solidity
	    function depositSafeTokens(uint128 amount, address owner) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 294](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L294)

	```solidity
	    function withdrawUSDC(address receiver) public onlyOwner {
	```



## L-5: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 68](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L68)

	```solidity
	    event TokensPurchased(
	```

- Found in src/SafeYieldPresale.sol [Line: 75](src/SafeYieldPresale.sol#L75)

	```solidity
	    event TokensClaimed(address indexed claimer, uint128 tokenAmount);
	```



## L-6: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 2](src/Counter.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```
